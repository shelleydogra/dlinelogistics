## Join D Line Logistics

" You're out there,
Day in ..., and day out.

Sometimes near
And sometimes far from home.
Sometimes you make your home on the road. 

It's not easy, 
But it's necessary.

You're a mom, a dad, 
Or a best friend. 
You're A PROFESSIONAL DRIVER, 
A MOVER OF OUR ECONOMY! 

Raw materials,
Building supplies, 
Food, fuel, 
All the things that make life comfortable, 
That make life possible.
  
No matter the distance, 
No matter the load, 
You get the job done, 
Safely and on time. "

**THANK YOU FOR MOVING OUR WORLD**
